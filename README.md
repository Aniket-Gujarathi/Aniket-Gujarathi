My name is Aniket Gujarathi and I am a graduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing an emphasis in robotics. My interests lie in deep learning and perception for robotic applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Currently, I am working at Gatik.ai as a Software Engineering Intern - Perception.
- ðŸ”­ Previously I have worked on developing a deep-learning network to improve local feature matching between images with extreme viewpoint changes. Check out our [project](https://uditsinghparihar.github.io/RoRD/) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08573) accepted for presentation at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2021. I have also worked on projects for tracking using event-driven perception in collaboration with the EDPR Lab, IIT, Genoa.
- ðŸŒ± I am interested in integrating the conventional methodologies like perception, control, localization and planning with active perception and Deep Learning to develop efficient autonomous robots/systems with practical applications.
- ðŸ’¬ I am happy to share my experiences in robotics and would like to hear about yours too.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me on my email - aniket.gujarathi@robotics.utias.utoronto.ca
