I am Aniket Gujarathi and I am an aspiring roboticist. I wish to make the world a better place through the advancements in robotics and AI. Happy to be a part of the evolution and transformation of robotics in today's world.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on developing deep-learning networks to improve local feature matching between images with extreme viewpoint changes. Check out our [project](https://uditsinghparihar.github.io/RoRD/) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08573) accepted for presentation at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2021. I am also working on a project for eye-gaze tracking using event-driven perception in collaboration with the EDPR Lab, IIT, Genoa.
- ðŸŒ± I am interested in integrating the conventional methodologies like perception, control, localization and planning with active perception and Deep Learning to develop efficient autonomous robots/systems with practical applications.
- ðŸ’¬ I am happy to share my experiences in robotics and would like to hear about yours too.
